# Ursina Game Engine Revamp (UGER)
Another rewrite of my ursina game engine

## Plans for the future
I have been planning on making this engine for a long time, and this is the third rewrite of it.
My plans are to add usability for coding objects, more editing options for objects and much, much more.

## Running the source code:
If you want to have an early look at the game engine you will need to obviusly download the source code first.
The you need to install the Ursina library and Pyinstaller, all other librarys are standard librarys from python.
```bash
pip install Ursina & pip install pyinstaller
```
